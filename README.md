# Fixed-point-iteration_not_optimisd
This program implements fixed point iteration for solving simple mathematical equations and it also includes basic error handling.

## Fixed point iteration method
This method is one of many for solving non-linear equations. Given that the equations are non-linear the program approximates
their solution until a desirable error limit is reached. which is set using 'tol' and 'tol_e' variables.

Four example functions can be selected for evalution in the code.

This implementation is not optimised as the user can put in any guess, this increases the number of iterations to converge to the
tolerance value.

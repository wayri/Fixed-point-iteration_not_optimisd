# Fixed-point-iteration_not_optimisd
This program implements fixed point iteration for solving simple mathematical equations and it also includes basic error handling.

## Fixed point iteration method
This method is one of many for solving non-linear equations. Given that the equations are non-linear the program approximates
their solution until a desirable error limit is reached. which is set using 'tol' and 'tol_e' variables.

Four example functions can be selected for evalution in the code.
